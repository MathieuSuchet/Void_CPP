## Ceiling pinch

### Currently being tested : Little random

|Setup|Description|Result|
|---|---|---|
| Overfitting setup | One side, same starting position | Works fine, a bit annoying to tune it so it doesn't farm the ball accel when hugging the ceiling |
| Little random | Both sides, little variance on position, velocity and orientation | Being tested
| Moderate random | Both sides, moderate variance on position, velocity and orientation | Not tested
| Complete random | Both sides, every targeted positions, high variance in velocity and moderate orientation | Not tested
